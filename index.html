  <p>Here are 3 random and fascinating facts to brighten your day:

1. **Australia is wider than the Moon**  
   The diameter of Australia is about 4,000 km, while the Moonâ€™s diameter is roughly 3,474 km. So yes, our continent stretches farther across than the Moon itselfhttps://www.today.com/life/inspiration/interesting-facts-rcna130243

2. **Venus spins backwards**  
   Unlike most planets in our solar system, Venus rotates clockwise on its axis. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east there[1](https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/interesting-facts-rcna130243).

3. **A sheep was the first animal to be cloned**  
   Dolly the sheep, born in 1996, was the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult cell, marking a major milestone in genetic science[1](https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/interesting-facts-rcna130243).
